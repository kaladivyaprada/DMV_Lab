Perfect 👌 — that screenshot is very helpful.

You have:

```
mysql-connector-j-9.5.0.jar
```

✅ correctly placed **inside your Weka folder** at
`C:\Program Files\Weka-3-8-6\`

That’s exactly right — so you’re one step away from connecting successfully.

---

## ✅ Now Run Weka with MySQL Connector

1. Open **Command Prompt (cmd.exe)** (⚠️ not PowerShell)
   → Press **Win + R**, type `cmd`, hit Enter.

2. Type these commands exactly:

```cmd
cd "C:\Program Files\Weka-3-8-6"
java -cp "weka.jar;mysql-connector-j-9.5.0.jar" weka.gui.GUIChooser
```

*(Make sure to include the quotes and semicolon — that’s crucial on Windows.)*

---

## ✅ Then in Weka:

1. Go to **Explorer → Preprocess → Open DB**
2. Enter this JDBC URL:

   ```
   jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/customerdb?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
   ```
3. Click the **🧍 person icon** beside URL → enter:

   ```
   Username: root
   Password: (your MySQL password)
   ```
4. Click **OK**
5. Now ⚡ **Execute** will be enabled
   → Run:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM customers;
   ```

You should now see your MySQL table data appear in the **Result** box, and you can **Load** it into Weka.

Would you like me to also show how to **edit Weka’s DatabaseUtils.props file** so this setup works permanently (without using the `java -cp ...` command every time)?
