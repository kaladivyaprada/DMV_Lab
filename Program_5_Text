Excellent — let’s go step-by-step in detail on how to complete this full Tableau project using the **Titanic Dataset** (for example, from Kaggle).
These steps assume you have Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public installed and a basic CSV dataset such as `titanic.csv`.

---

## 🧭 Step 0: Prepare the Dataset

Ensure your dataset includes (at minimum) these columns:

| Column      | Description                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| PassengerId | Unique ID                         |
| Survived    | 1 = Survived, 0 = Did not survive |
| Pclass      | Passenger class (1, 2, 3)         |
| Name        | Passenger name                    |
| Sex         | Male/Female                       |
| Age         | Age in years                      |
| Fare        | Fare paid                         |
| SibSp       | Siblings/spouses aboard           |
| Parch       | Parents/children aboard           |
| Embarked    | Port of embarkation               |

---

## 🪜 Step 1: Connect and Import Data

1. Open **Tableau Desktop** or **Tableau Public**.
2. Click **“Connect to a file” → “Text File”**.
3. Select your `titanic.csv` file.
4. Tableau will load a preview. Click **“Sheet 1”** at the bottom to start analysis.

---

## ⚙️ Step 2: Perform Calculations

### (i) Calculate the Survival Rate

1. In the **Data pane**, click the dropdown → **Create Calculated Field**.
2. Name it **“Survival Rate”**.
3. Enter the formula:

   ```tableau
   SUM(IIF([Survived] = 1, 1, 0)) / COUNT([PassengerId])
   ```
4. Click **OK**.

✅ This calculated field gives the proportion of passengers who survived.

---

### (ii) Calculate the Average Age (or Average Fare)

1. Create another Calculated Field → name it **“Average Age”**.
2. Formula:

   ```tableau
   AVG([Age])
   ```

   (You can similarly create `Average Fare` using `AVG([Fare])`.)

---

### (iii) Calculate the Total Fare

1. Create another Calculated Field → name it **“Total Fare”**.
2. Formula:

   ```tableau
   SUM([Fare])
   ```
3. Click **OK**.

✅ You now have 3 calculated fields:

* Survival Rate
* Average Age (or Fare)
* Total Fare

---

## 🧩 Step 3: Perform Group Operations

### (i) Group Passengers by Age

1. In the Data Pane, right-click on **Age → Create → Group**.
2. Click **Bins** instead of Group for continuous ranges:

   * Choose **Size of bins = 10** (for example: 0–10, 11–20, …)
   * Name it **“Age Group”**.
3. Click **OK**.

✅ You’ll now have a new field `[Age (bin)]` representing Age Groups.

---

### (ii) Group Passengers by Fare

1. Right-click **Fare → Create → Bins**.
2. Choose **Size of bins** such as `50` (depending on the dataset range).
3. Name it **“Fare Group”**.
4. Click **OK**.

✅ You now have `[Fare (bin)]`.

---

### (iii) Create a Set: Passengers Who Survived

1. In the Data pane, right-click **Survived → Create → Set**.
2. Name it **“Survived Set”**.
3. In the dialog:

   * Select only value **“1”** (which means survived).
   * Click **OK**.

✅ This set will include only survivors.

---

## 🔁 Step 4: Perform Set Operations

### (i) Set: Passengers Who Survived

Already created above — **Survived Set**.

### (ii) Set: Passengers Who Did Not Survive

1. Right-click **Survived → Create → Set**.
2. Name it **“Not Survived Set”**.
3. Select **“0”** in the dialog.
4. Click **OK**.

### (iii) Set: Passengers Who Traveled in First Class

1. Right-click **Pclass → Create → Set**.
2. Name it **“First Class Set”**.
3. Select **“1”**.
4. Click **OK**.

✅ You can now compare these sets (e.g., use set intersections, unions, etc., in Tableau).

---

## 📊 Step 5: Create Visualizations for the Dashboard

### (i) **Survival Rate by Age Group**

1. Go to **Sheet 2**.
2. Drag **Age (bin)** to Columns.
3. Drag **Survived** to Rows → change aggregation to **AVG** (right-click → Measure → Average).
4. Format axis (0 to 1) to represent percentage.
5. Optionally, drag **Sex** to Color for gender comparison.
6. Rename the sheet: **“Survival Rate by Age Group”**.

---

### (ii) **Average Fare by Fare Group**

1. Go to **Sheet 3**.
2. Drag **Fare (bin)** to Columns.
3. Drag **Fare** to Rows → change aggregation to **AVG**.
4. Change mark type to **Bar**.
5. Rename the sheet: **“Average Fare by Fare Group”**.

---

### (iii) **Survivors by Class**

1. Go to **Sheet 4**.
2. Drag **Pclass** to Color and to Label.
3. Drag **Survived** to Rows → change aggregation to **SUM**.
4. Convert the chart to **Pie Chart**:

   * From the **Marks** dropdown → select **Pie**.
5. Drag **SUM(Survived)** to Angle and **Pclass** to Color.
6. Rename the sheet: **“Survivors by Class”**.

---

## 🌇 Step 6: Add Additional Visualizations

You can add more as desired, such as:

* **Survival Rate by Gender**
* **Survival Rate by Embarked Port**
* **Age vs Fare Scatter Plot (colored by survival)**

Example:

1. Drag **Age** to Columns.
2. Drag **Fare** to Rows.
3. Drag **Survived** to Color.
4. Rename the sheet “Fare vs Age by Survival”.

---

## 🧱 Step 7: Create and Combine Dashboards

1. Click the **New Dashboard** button at the bottom (looks like a window with a “+”).
2. On the left, drag your created **sheets** into the dashboard area:

   * “Survival Rate by Age Group”
   * “Average Fare by Fare Group”
   * “Survivors by Class”
   * Any additional visualizations
3. Arrange them neatly:

   * Top: Survival Rate by Age Group (bar chart)
   * Middle: Average Fare by Fare Group
   * Bottom: Survivors by Class (pie)
4. Add **Titles** and **Legends** for clarity.
5. You can add **Filters** (e.g., by Sex or Class) for interactivity:

   * Right-click a field → **Show Filter**.
6. Rename your dashboard: **Titanic Survival Dashboard**.

---

## 🧾 Optional Enhancements

* Format tooltips to show detailed info.
* Add filters for **Gender**, **Class**, **Embarked**.
* Add **dynamic annotations** for insights (e.g., “Higher survival rate for 20–30 age group”).
